ZEN
======================

The idea behind ZEN is that your code syncs across all platforms, instantly, and that it is easy to collaborate with other people (you can see what they type). 

You can also set goals with ZEN to keep track of how you're coding.

ZEN is designed to be clutter-free, with a large code font size so you can focus on your code.
